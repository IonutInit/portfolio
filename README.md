# PORTFOLIO

The repository for my portfolio, live at [ionut.cojocaru.co.uk](https://ionut.cojocaru.co.uk/).



## Contents

#### Backend

A small server for communicating with OpenAI

#### Client

Build with Vite. Contains all the formatting and linting settings.

Vite creates a [rollup error](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/2139) on build, which at this point I'm unable to debug, so I made a [copy of the client](https://github.com/IonutInit/portfolio-deployed) with Create React App, which is deployed.
